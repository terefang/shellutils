Boot your rescue media.

Scan for volume groups:

---
> lvm vgscan -v
---

Activate all volume groups:

---
> lvm vgchange -a y
---

List logical volumes:

---
> lvm lvs â€“all
---

With this information, and the volumes activated, you should be able to mount the volumes:

---
> mount /dev/volumegroup/logicalvolume /mountpoint
---
