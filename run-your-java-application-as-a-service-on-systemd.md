## Run Your Java App as a Service

Bring your JAR file to Ubuntu as a service using this example service wrapper. 
See how to make it work, including automatic starts and logging tips.

Say you have a JAR file and you need to run it as a service. 
Additionally, you want it to start automatically if/when system restarts.

Systemd has a built-in mechanism to create custom services, 
enabling them to get started at system boot time and start/stop 
them as a service. 

### Step 1: Create a Service

~~~
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/my-webapp.service

---
[Unit]
Description=My Webapp Java REST Service
[Service]
User=app
# The configuration file application.properties should be here:
#change this to your workspace
WorkingDirectory=/home/app/workspace
#path to executable. 
#executable is a bash script which calls jar 
fileExecStart=/home/app/workspace/my-webapp
SuccessExitStatus=143
TimeoutStopSec=10
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
~~~

### Step 2: Create a Bash Script to Call Your Service

Hereâ€™s the bash script that calls your JAR file: my-webapp

~~~
#!/bin/sh

sudo /usr/bin/java -jar my-webapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server config.yml
~~~

Don't forget to give your script execute permission: sudo chmod u+x my-webapp 

### Step 3: Start the Service

~~~
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable my-webapp.service
sudo systemctl start my-webapp
sudo systemctl status my-webapp
~~~

### Step 4: Set Up Logging

First, run: sudo journalctl --unit=my-webapp . See real-time logs by using the -f option.

If you want to trim them, use -n <# of lines> to view the specified number of lines of the log:

~~~
sudo journalctl -f -n 1000 -u spinal-webapp
~~~

Tail the live log using the -f option:

~~~
sudo journalctl -f -u my-webapp
~~~

Stop the service by using:

~~~
sudo systemctl stop my-webapp
~~~

__END__
